# Meeting Summaries RAG System

A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system for local meeting summaries. This system allows you to index your meeting summaries stored in Markdown or text files and query them using natural language.

## Features

- **Document Processing**: Automatically processes Markdown and text files, extracting metadata from filenames and content
- **Vector Storage**: Uses ChromaDB for efficient vector storage and retrieval
- **Flexible Model Support**: Works with both OpenAI API (initial phase) and local models via Ollama (final setup)
- **Multiple Interfaces**: Command-line, programmatic, and web interfaces

## Getting Started

See [README_SIMPLE.md](README_SIMPLE.md) for detailed instructions on how to set up and use the system.
